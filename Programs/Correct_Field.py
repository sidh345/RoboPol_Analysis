Q. What am I trying to do with this code?

Go to the o/p directory of reduced field(output data of pipeline for any RoboPol field). For each night/epoch of observation, there is a csv file containing all the main data.
Collect all these data.csv files, and on each of them do the following operation:

    1. Find objects affected by any of the systematics of RoboPol(flat errors due to dust specks, nearby object contamination, Sextractor flagged objects etc).

    2. For all other objects, make an astropy table which will have only clean objects and their important parameters, which I will use with further codes for finding standard stars.

# for more info on this peice of code, refer to the program making_flat_histograms.py. This bit of code appends all the objects (by their serial no in the data.csv file beginning from 0) affected by any of the systematics of RoboPol system. The output is a list of bad objects. The remaining objects are then collected in an astropy table with their corresponding measured values for that epoch by subsequent codes(not this function).
