\begin{abstract}
This document contains details of the analysis performed by me in order to find Standard polarised star candidates from 3 years of RoboPol survey data. The objects in the fields 
of RoboPol images are afflicted with various systenatic effects, which are addressed in the codes. As a rough 
estimate, I expect to get about 70-100 such promising candidates, which will then be followed up by observations through RoboPol as the central object to ascertain their polarisation 
non-variability .

\section{Introduction}

RoboPol has been taking data since late 2013 onwards. Although designed for observations of blazars and other point sources, owing to it's large field of view of $13\times13 arcminutes$, it has observed
